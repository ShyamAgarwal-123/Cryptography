#Download all the files from the cryptography code files folder and put all of them in the same folder
#Download the Demo file from the demo folder or use the link- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZ90sbKhMGPtpMKDBsXRlwB7w0vLPj23s4RIiILi80U/edit?usp=sharing
#all the steps to run the code are also mentioned with screenshots in the demo file

#how to run the code
1. Run the KeyPairGeneration.java File To generate key Pairs(private key and public key)
2. You Can See Key Pairs Have been Generated
3. Open the FileSigning.java code file And upload a file that you want to sign Digitaly by Specifying its file Path in the code(in this case name.docx) as well as upload the private key generated by specifying its path in the code to Make a digital Signature of it and Then Run the FileSigning.java file. and as you run it a Digital Signature will be Created.
4. Open the VeriyingSignature.java code file and Upload the file you want to verify, the digital signature generated and the public key by specifying their path at the respective portion of the code and then run the VeriyingSignature.java code.
5. you will get the output depending on whether the file uploaded in step no 4 has been Tempered or not.


# Please do the above steps in IntelliJ IDE.
